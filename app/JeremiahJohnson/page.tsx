                                    What seems apparent to me immeidately upon meeting Jeremiah Johnon, who is a long tenured Rivercom member and most notable serves as their Operations Center Manager. I was trying to verify the guys real name bevause at this point they have tamopered with or falsified almost every piece of evidence and character and so forth. FOR EXAMPLE; the courts are saying Rivercom 911 now claims Jenna, the female with Jeremiah when he picked us up; the same female who punched me and also made lewd comments accusing me of vulgar things I had not said nor ever wanted to think. I actually watched this womam, with Jeremiah, walk into the Rivercom 911 center secure door at the Chelan County Court house the day I was realeased from jail. I seen her swipe an access card then walk inside. Without a doubt. So someone is lying here." </p>

                                <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                                    That headline sound too dramatic? Well its precisely what happened.
                                    At the end of the day Jeremiah made a massive mistake and committed a signifanctly more serious set of crimes than anyone wants to talk about.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>He had to be a ring leader and centrally complicit in the scheme top kidnap us during a 911 call for emergency medical assistance.</li>
                                        <li>He knows better than anybody the severityof the crimes he engaged in; he runs the call center.</li>
                                        <li>He knew I had him dead to rights and he attempted to MURDER me by swatting me</li>
                                        <li>Rivercom is not some small town yokles dispatcher. They serve all of Chelan and Douglas county.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <h4>Why So Angry </h4>
                                <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                                    I just dont know what person would talk all that death talk Jeremiah was; if listem closely you can hear it in the video. You can see also hear his wife Jenna say she is going to "slap the shit out of me" and beat my ass. These people were extremely violent. While perhaps unpleasant sounding I am not threatening anyone. Im bewildered and scared for the life and wellbeing of my passenger, myself, and the dogs. Its a lot of responsibilitiy. And its an extremely tricky situation.
                                    I can't flee and get help; I am convinced these are cruel sick and corrupt officials who would just as well kill my passenger then blame me if I were to leave on my own for help. I cant call anyone there is no cell service just 911 and Jenna kept answering when I called. I cant fight my way out of this: there are 5 people who all work for various Chelan county agencies and I am more than well aware they would shoot me. They eventually say so. <br></br>
                                    If I may, I am just not seeing the context for <em>any</em> of the vitreal being leveled by Jeremiah or Jenna. Evan the tow driver surrendered his stake and had some words for Jeremiah for dragging him into this mess. Well, I in fact had asked Jeremiah what the hell was going on. "why are you doing this to me?". I asked him why did they refuse us an ambulance, then bring us way out here and ambush us with a tow truck trying to extort us? Why wont you let me go? What have I ever done to you or anyone else in this county for that matter?". Jeremiah looked like he was really struggling with staying cohesive so I knew it was the time to politely ask some questions and find out who set this all up. Again I politely begged Jeremiah to tell me why did I deserve to be prayed on, lied about, and murdered? Jeremiah's eyes finally vector to my eyes and he says thru parsed lips "oh hahahah....theres...theres a LOT wrong with you".<br></br>
                                    Keep in mind I have not been to wenatchee since 2010. I dont know anyone there i can think of. THe 6 years I lived there I had one traffic stop, no valid license on purpose. I was a startup owner and I was a full time university student. Its wild to me anyone could hate me that much. I know a lot of people hate me, but this was next level. Threw their careers away and sunk a multi million dollar PSAP just because I have a ;lot wrong with me? What does that even mean? Because I havent been a fugative in over 5 YEARS. I have not been engaged in any criminal activity for DECADES.</p>



                                <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                                    For a 911 CALL CENTER OPERATIONS MANAGER in his shoes; doing what he did, all I did to enrage him was I simply could not pay 1000 dollars cash on the spot, and I asked to leave with my passenger who still had not even been so much as assessed. As a dispatcher Jeremiah is well aware of the need to assess all parties of a medical inbound emergency. They not only refused to assess or treat; they have not mentioned her name one time in any logs, incident reports or summatioons of the incident. . His wife actually assaulted me; punched me in the face with a closed fist when I wasnt looking. Im convinced the murder dialogue was not a joke. It was not just a temper talking. No, it was a panicked kidnapper who had just been told very cooly and calmly that he made a massive error when he decided to kidnap and extort me, and most damnding, whem he used his position of trust to abuse us and block us from legitimate life saving urgent medical assistance. He was shaking like a leaf on a tree and chain smoking. The death talk wasnthollow threats at me; they were vivid plans orders, or request. And he very nearly achieved success. Nothing I did or said that day warranted the type of death threats Jeremiah made. Keep in mind he barely even made the threats known to me; it wasnt until much later I learned he was calling in his deputy buddy to murder me.
