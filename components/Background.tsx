           <p> On July 4th my friend and her dogs made a camping trip that forever changed our lives. The most reprehensible abuse of public trust I have ever imagined was leveled against us that day for absolutely no reason. I will do my best to allow you to come to your own conclusions. Here is a list of facts, in review. These items are not contested and are in fact contained within the courts own evidence. Please keep in mind; that this evidence is what is left after a years effort to tamper with all of my evidence, and most damaging; eliminating the details which were exculpitory.</p>

 <p>We were 100% law abiding guest using a tax payer supported public park, with the proper pass and doing so in full accordance with all rules posted on the entrance.</p>

 <p>I was not driving illegally, and I had valid insurance, drivers license and vehicle tabs on a vehicle which I paid for and owned outright; a 2007 Ford F150.</p>

 <p>Vehicle was in excellent working order although I had a flat spare I wasnt yet aware of.</p>

 <p>While traveling in Colockum park headed home; we entered a wrong way loop that maps falsely indicated as a passage to Blewitt Pass.</p>

 <p>After some 20 miles of slow travel, relitively peaceful and enjoying the scenary and being careful to not damage vehicle we ended up at a junction which had a timber elk camp and there were dozens of trees down all around the area. The trees were intentionally laid to block the road way. I walked in a bit and seen there were also some old growth red rot type trees which indicated for me anyhow, this has been blocked off for many years. Deciding that the road was now impassable altogether; I decided to back up and out of the long narrow passage of primitive road I was on. As I began backing up I seen a flat tire in my rear view. </p>

 <p>I moved the truck to an opening clear enough to change the tire then discovered my spare was also flat. The factory alloy wheel being expensive, plus the fact that I didnt see any damage or punctures to the tire on the alloy wheel, inclined me to utilize the spare as the lesser of two evils since spares are much cheaper and easier to find; in fact they dont really need to match as they are not seen other than when in emergency use. So I was better off abusing a flat spare on a basic steel spare wheel than I was abusing a 2007 Ford factory alloy wheel with good Firestone AT tires that matched and could likely be saved.</p>

 <p>As it turned out I was right too. When the incident boiled over and the dispatchers failed to extort me, failed to insite me to violence, and failed to get me shot after essentially swatting me with Sheriff Deputies; they resorted to manufacturing a set of crimes to have me detained. My passenger was given my keys and sent on her way after they put air in the tire.... and thats all it took for my truck to drive up and out of wenatchee. I didnt need any repairs. I didnt need any tires. Or wheels. Just as I repeatedly claimed and exactly why I never consented to anythiung like that. Instead they did it behind my back; stole my vehicle, drove it to the house were taken to. Then demanded cash for their deeds. </p>



 <p>I offered to pay by card they flatly refused. They say they take cash only which is illegal in washington state. I asked how he came up with a 1000 dollar even bill and he already confirmed that was with tax; he said he can say he wants anygthing he wants and the junk wheel he brought was total trash, wrong size, tire was rotted..not even legal.</p>

 <p>Most concerning is I asked for invoice, receipt, bill, tow bill or impound or seizure documents and they insisted they would not be providing any. I asked if I could go get my truck out of impound on monday and Jeremiah laughed and said "you dont get it boy: your truck is gone, its mine now.". I knew he was trying to incite me. </p>

 <p>I immediately recognized the whole thing was a ruse to incite someone.. they were attempting to provoke me. I was in the clear and I was patient and wanted to try one more thing to see if they were really after free money or if they were attempting to harm me. I asked them if I could call a family member to have cash brought there. I have family nearby in Peshasten. They promptly refused to accomodate me with access to calling. I asked if they could call them. Again they refused. Keep in mind this house they took us to is isolated in a canyon dead end road. No cell service for me or my passenger, yet they all seemed to be making calls on cell phones fine. Not sure why. I seen my passenger for a little bit as she wondered out momentarily, ealry on in the argumnent phase. I asked if she reached family she said her phone was out and I asked her to try to get them to let her call the son. Ultimately they never allowed either of us to contact anyone. For well over an hour they held us there and refused to call our family, refused to call us an ambulance, and refused to surrender my keys or even my passenger later on so we could leave and get help.</p>

 <p>Jeremiah did tell me much later as the deputies were close to arriving, towards the end; that I better get off his property or he was going to shoot me. I asked for my keys and he ssaid the truck is his now. I asked for my passenger and he and his wife the other dispatcher who came with him to pick us up; they said "shes with us now." and they refused to let me ask if its ok to leave and get help. </p>

 <p>At around 5pm I made a duress call to 911 seeking immediate medical attention for a dying passenger and life threatening medical emergencies for both her and myself afer an all day attempt to get my truck through 20 miles of rugged off road terrain.</p>

 <p>The female victim is seen and heard on the video the court presented as evidence; she is berating me and demanding 1000 dollars CASH for saving my passengers life and threatens to "slap the shit out of me" for no reason during her tirade, possibly because I would not pay her the cash ransom she demanded.</p>

 <p>The female victim also states that my passenger was 'definately going to die' had I waited another hour and not called when I did.</p>

 <p> There was some argument about a roadside repair which was nothing more than a theft of my truck from the place I left it. Without ever consulting with me on that matter f moving or touching my vehiucle, unbeknownst to us; the Operations Center Manager from Rivercom 911 in Chelan County, had contacted some friend of his who drove and or operated some sort of tow comopany perhaps; the name on the truck said BTE Towing Cashmere, conflicting with the police report which states Stands Mountain View Towing.</p>

 <p>I was immediately and admimently clear that nobody was allowed to touch my vehicle without my explicit permission. This stern and direct responsse came after intiial conversations with dispatchers indicated some intent to provide a completeky unsolicited and unneeded repair of my vehicle. I called for serious emergency medical help and the dispatcher was going into a dialogue about "is your truck in your name, is it paid for? What year is it. How many miles." I knew these people were violating protocols and much more I suspected and I was very clear and stern that there was nothing wrong with my truck and I am not interested and NOBODY is to touch my truck unless I am there and authorize it first. It was rediculous how pervasive and nagging the dispatcher was in regards to "we know good mechanics". My truck was in top running order. Ive owner it since it was almost new. </p>

             <p>During the initial 911 call, the CAD archive indicates that I did in fact intiate contact with 911 due to immediate pressing medical emergencies:</p>
      <p>a. My passenger is a 58 year old disabled woman with a few serious medical issues and one at hand was her diabetes and the fact she forgot to bring insulin as I found out after we woke up the next day. 
     b. The second emergency I declared was that of my self for possible stroke; I have had a stroke in the past and this day I had concerns about my face being numb on one side after a horrific attempt to get my disabled vehicle out of the park and back to services in order to get this woman an aid car. </p>
